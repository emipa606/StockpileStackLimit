Allows you to set a limit on the item stack (per cell) of each stockpile. Save friendly!
给你的储存区添加一个物品堆叠上限（每格），与存档兼容！

Known issue:
If it exists in a stockpile with limit and the number of stacks is below the limit, you cannot pick up the goods.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Since Stockpile Stack Limit conflicts with stockpile's priority setting and has not been updated for a long time. It was recreated from the Stockpile Stack Limit.
Many thanks to Ilyaki and for the MIT license to make it possible to become reality. Some source code comes from Ilyaki's Stockpile Stack Limit.
This is a development version, and you are welcome to contribute to the github repository as follows:
